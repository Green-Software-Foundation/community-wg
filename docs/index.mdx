## Summary

- Facilitate broad adoption of Green Software standards and best practices through the creation of partnerships, content, events and programs.
- Ensure diverse participation of stakeholders in the development and implementation of Green Software.

### How we work

- We hold online monthly meetings every second Wednesday of the month @ 1600 (BST) / 1100 (EST).
- We are structured into a more extensive set of smaller groups focussed on different projects. Each of these projects has its own meetings and method of working.
- The monthly meeting is a time for the entire Community Working Group members to discuss plans and successes, invite participation, and share blockers.

### Projects

- [Green Software for Practitioners Training (previously Principles)](https://learn.greensoftware.foundation/)
- [Green Software Patterns](https://patterns.greensoftware.foundation/)
- [Green Software Speakers](https://greensoftware.foundation/projects/speakers)
- [Green Software Writers](https://greensoftware.foundation/projects/writers)
- [Events & Experiences](https://greensoftware.foundation/projects/events-and-experiences)


### Proposing a new project

- To propose a project, we ask that you create a short project document and gather the interest of at least three people from 2 different member organizations.

- Reach out to the chairs, who will add you to the next working group meeting agenda.

- If the working group reaches consensus and agrees, your project will be made official and start receiving the support of the Foundation.

- However, often it requires several conversations with the working group to evolve your project proposal to a version where everyone is comfortable.

- Once launched, the working group will support you in executing your project and source the resources required from the Foundation and its members.
